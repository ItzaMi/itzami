### Hi there 👋

I'm a **self taught web developer with a Master's Degree in Psychology** currently working at [Coletiv](https://coletiv.com/) as a **ReactJS front end web developer**

I also have a knack for 🎨 design 🎨 so check out my [Dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/ItzaMi)

Currently making plans to create a 🖊️ blog 🖊️ and to work on my forever dead [text-based medieval rpg game](https://github.com/ItzaMi/medieval-adventure-game)
